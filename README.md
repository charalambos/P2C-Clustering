# P2C-Clustering
Clustering module in IEEE PAMI 2013: A Framework for Automatic Modeling from Point Cloud Data. A robust unsupervised clustering algorithm P2C, based on a hierarchical statistical analysis of the geometric properties of the data.

The entire clustering module in IEEE PAMI 2013: A Framework for Automatic Modeling from Point Cloud Data. 
A variant of the first stage of the algorithm was first introduced in IEEE CVPR 2009: Automatic reconstruction of cities from remote sensor data and can be easily reproduced by changing the distributions as described in the paper.

The copyright for the included bilateral filtering code belongs to Sylvain Paris and Fr√©do Durand.

Technical details:

- The project file is provided for Code::Blocks IDE. 
- It requires the libraries Image Magick, fftw3, and opencv2.
- A small sample file is provided in the data folder [sample_input.pfm]. If you want to generate your own input files you have to user StructurePointcloud. The generated file [geo_bbox_*.xyz_D.pfm"] is the input to this software. The output corresponding to the sample input file is also included for patches and surfaces. Usually you should expect about 50% reduction in the number of patches by the second-tier clustering.
- Usage: P2C-Clustering input_structured_pointcloud.pfm
- Input files can be generated from LiDAR data using the StructurePointcloud code also provide in a separate repository.

Disclaimer: This code is part of a larger software package. 
I have tried to extract and clean up only the code relating to the clustering however some unused code may still be present.
